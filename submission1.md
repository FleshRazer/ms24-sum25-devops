## Task 1: Benefits of commit signing
The main benefits of commit signing are:
1. Commit signing makes sure that the person is really the author of the commit. For example, I can create a commit with any user name and email address but I won't be able to sign it without that person's private key.
2. Commit signing makes sure that nobody except the commit author can edit the commit or its metadata (e.g. creation time).
